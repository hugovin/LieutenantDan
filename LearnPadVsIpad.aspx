                                                     <p>The iPad has been hugely successful as a mass market consumer device and has been adopted by many schools due to its ease of use, the intuitive nature of the touch screen and the additional engagement that this brings for young learners. However, trying to integrate the iPad into a shared classroom environment and using it with existing network resources and curriculum content can prove difficult.<br><br> <em><span class="pun">LearnPad has been designed to easily fit into your classroom and support the content you already use, as well as providing a simple and easy way of accessing some great new educational "apps".

                                                     <p>One of the key limitations of the iPad for schools is its lack of support for Adobe Flash. 95% of the curriculum content schools use is written in Flash, and as such will not run on the iPad. LearnPad is built on Google's Android operating system, which natively supports Flash activities and content, including websites and content from great publishers. LearnPad allows you to bring the engagement and excitement of touch screen to your existing curriculum content.</p>
