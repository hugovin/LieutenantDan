                                                     <p>The launch of the Apple iPad in 2010 had a fundamental effect on 'tablet computing'. There was a widespread adoption of the device and from this a new generation of 'Post PC' tablet computers began to appear. Fundamentally, tablet computing had taken a new form, based on the growing popularity of 'Smartphones' and the functionality that these devices, and in turn their operating systems, provided. In essence, the tablet computers emerging were larger, more functional versions of the smartphones that preceded them. </p>
                                                     <p>Leading the field through 2010 and 2011 was Apple's iPad, based on its iOS mobile operating system. However, in 2011, the first generation of tablets computers produced by industry leading hardware manufacturer including Samsung, Motorola, Lenovo, Toshiba, Acer and Asus began to appear. These devices utilized Google's mobile operating system, Android. Several other tablet devices were launched based on proprietary operating systems, including Research in Motions Blackberry Playbook and HPs TouchPad. </p>
                                                     <p>Following on from the earlier traditional Tablet PCs, several hardware devices were launched that ran Microsoft Windows 7 OS. These have struggled to gain market share against the iPad and Android tablets, but the launch of Windows 8, due in late 2012, will attempt to address this. </p>

                                                    <p>Tablet computers provide a unique opportunity to create a truly portable learning experience. Lightweight with a long battery life, they offer possibilities not previously seen with other 'mobile' computing solutions. This lends itself to better use of technology within teaching. For example, quick access to reference material during a lesson, previously difficult to achieve with existing Information Technology, can bring key advantages and enhance learning. Using tablets in less typical scenarios, such as field trips, workshops or physical education lessons offers opportunities for research, evidence gathering and presentation. Brining devices such as these into the classroom and everyday life for students is in itself a learning experience. Couple this with the resources a tablet computer can deliver, such as text and reference books, audio and video resources, internet research, document preparation and review, and specific eLearning applications and activities and you have a truly versatile learning tool.</p>

Tablets devices can be expensive items themselves, but what about the cost of managing and maintaining them? What happens when these devices break or are damaged? With some devices, only proprietary content can be used, so what is the overall cost of adding new activities should they not support existing content? There may of course be positive results in implementing tablet devices. As they are primarily battery powered, the potential running costs to schools could be lower. </p>

                                                    <p>Currently tablet devices are primarily focused in the consumer space, with each device being 'owned' by an individual user. This approach makes it difficult to provision devices for use by multiple students of differing abilities. Typical deployments of tablets in schools are not yet 1:1, thus there is a need for each device to be 'shared'. This leads to complications when provisioning content, applications and resources. Finding a way to allow multiple students to access individualized content on shared devices should be an important consideration. </p>
                                                    <p>Tablet computers hold the potential to change the way in which eLearning resources are delivered and consumed by students. Their versatility and flexibility are unrivalled, and tablet deployments are set to grow fast and in large numbers. However, technology should adapt to teaching needs, not the other way around. It is critical to ensure that bringing any new technology into the educational environment improves the provision of Information Technology resources, fits with the teaching needs of the faculty and students and, more importantly, has specific learning benefits. </p>

How will existing Wi-Fi infrastructures cope with a huge increase in connected devices? How much additional broadband bandwidth will be required to support mobile access to media rich internet websites and resources? Can the fixed network structure support this? Should we consider 'on-device' content deployments so this infrastructure is less impacted? Mobile devices have come to rely on connectivity, so supporting this will be an important consideration for any device deployment. </p>

Many schools are located in old buildings, with solid stone wall construction, numerous corridors and unusual floor plan layouts. There may be remote classrooms with no wired connectivity, temporary 'portacabin' classrooms and areas of the schools where neither wired nor wireless connectivity is easily achieved. Couple this with large campus areas or geographically distant buildings means providing consistent connectivity can prove very challenging and costly. Careful considerations of what resources are used with these portable devices and at what times will allow for a more consistent use of them as a learning tool. </p>

One of the key aspects of device management is to provide a simplified yet powerful range of features to ensure devices remain operational and available to their users. This can range from a simple 'inventory' of connected devices and their status, to deploying system changes, updates and controlling activities. Ensuring that you can manage these mobile devices and maintain their operational status is critical if they are to be used as an integrated learning tool. </p>

                                                    <p>Traditionally, computing in school has involved some form of security and control to help protect both the students and equipment. This would range from content filtering and anti-virus software, to restrictions to desktop access and student profiling. As tablet computers are predominantly consumer devices, integration into an educational environment and support for securing and controlling access to applications, content and device settings was not of primary concern. It is essential therefore to ensure that the same levels of security and control can be applied to any mobile device that will offer students access to network resources and content. Additionally, as these devices are more portable and offer the flexibility to access the internet away from the schools filtered network, additional security should be considered to protect the student when connecting to other networks.</p>

                                                    <p>With tablets devices has emerged a new method of sourcing and delivering applications and content and the emergence of 'app stores'. Again, these stores have been designed for the consumer market and as such do not allow schools to use traditional methods of purchasing and licensing and may not provide content aligned to the teaching curriculum. Furthermore, without specific content and application management and deployment solutions, delivering new content to multiple devices can be problematic and time consuming. Ensuring that device can be updated and new content deployed en-mass is a critical consideration. </p>

                                                     <p>The design goals for LearnPad were simple: To provide a high quality, safe and secure tablet computer to allow students to access existing eLearning content as well as other school network resources. Additionally, LearnPad was to take full advantage of the new generation of 'apps' and content being developed for mobile devices. Furthermore, managing and deploying new activities and applications to devices, as well as monitoring and controlling them from a central location, was a fundamental requirement. </p>
                                                     <p>LearnPad was developed on Google's Android OS as this provided the most cost effective and flexible platform, as well as being available on a number of different hardware vendor devices, thus providing schools with a choice of devices. </p>

                                                    <p>LearnPad was launched in January 2011 and has rapidly been adopted in many schools as the tablet device of choice. LearnPad deployments range from private nurseries and day care facilities, to mainstream state and private primary and secondary schools, as well as higher and further educational establishments and community colleges. LearnPad also has specific use within the Special Educational Needs environment, providing a safe and secure platform to deliver inclusive activities for children with learning disabilities. In March 2012, LearnPad won the prestigious BESA Educational Resource Award for Best Primary Information Technology resource and was nominated in a further two categories, Best Secondary Information Technology resource and the coveted Innovation Award. LearnPad has continued to be adopted by not only UK schools, but educational institutions across the globe </p>

                                                    <p>The LearnPad user interface provides a fully customizable, secure and intuitive way for students to quickly navigate to subject related activities. It locks out access to device settings, prevents accidental changes such as disabling the Wi-Fi connection and only allows students to access pre-approved applications and content. Approved applications can be selected on the device itself or via the central management portal. It also features a secure 'Teacher' screen that is password protected. On this screen a teacher can access applications and links not available to the students, providing a dual functioning student/faculty device </p>

                                                    <strong><i class="icon-minus"></i> Secure Integrated Web Browser  </strong><br/><br/>
                                                    <p>LearnPad also features an integrated secure web browser, with an 'on-device' white-list of approved websites. This web browser present a full screen experience of any website and removes the URL bar, thus stopping the student navigating away from the specified site. This helps to maintain focus on the activity at hand and prevents accidental or deliberate navigation to other sites. Additionally, off-site hyperlinks embedded in the web page are disabled, ensuring that the student remains on the activity presented. This whitelist is available irrespective of any additional network filtering, thus should the LearnPad be connected to an unfiltered network, such as a home Wi-Fi, the integrity of the device is maintained. </p>

                                                    <strong><i class="icon-minus"></i> Customizable Interface  </strong><br/><br/>
                                                    <p>LearnPad can be completely customized; allowing teachers or administrators to design their own backgrounds, icons and lessons and define exactly which applications and content are available in each. Create interface lesson sets for individual students, year groups or even subject areas. Once created, lesson sets can be applied either at the device itself, via QR codes shown to the built in camera, or deployed to a group of LearnPads via the management portal. </p>

                                                    <strong><i class="icon-minus"></i> Content Synchronization   </strong><br/><br/>
                                                    <p>Running silently in the background is the LearnPad content updater service, which calls into the management portal on a regular schedule to look for new content, applications and lesson sets. The content updater service will silently install any new content it receives, so the user is never prompted or interrupted. It also feeds back information to the management system, such as battery charge level, location, storage capacity, Wi-Fi details and current usage, so that the administrator has a constant view of device deployments within the school. </p>

                                                    <p>The LearnPad management system allows you to upload and store your own content securely and assign it to a specific lesson sets. When a lesson sets is applied to a device, all of the necessary content and applications are automatically downloaded, rolled out and silently installed, with no user interaction required. Applying a lesson sets to multiple LearnPads means content will be delivered and installed on all of them automatically. Additionally, the management system can deliver application upgrades, system updates and can be used to expire or remove content from any connected device.</p>

                                                    <p>The LearnPad management portal allows a teacher or administrator to manage a deployment of LearnPads and monitor and report on their status. Device reporting includes managing content storage capacity, battery and Wi-Fi status, location and current device lesson sets. An active 'dashboard' highlights problem areas, such as devices with low battery charge, or devices that have failed to report in after a defined period of time. All of these functions allow the administrator a quick 'birds-eye' view of device status within the school, allowing them to quickly and efficiently address issues to maximize device reliability </p>

Use background images and icons to design a layout then using a graphical interface, simply 'drag & drop' the activities you want into each category. Once a lesson sets is defined it can be applied to as many devices as required. Update the lesson sets with a new activity and this will automatically be sent to each device. The portal can be used to push lesson sets changes to multiple devices or generate a QR Code and apply this to individual LearnPads using their built in camera. </p>

Also, they are limited to supplying platform specific content, such as 'apps' The LearnPad store is different. It contains a huge range of curated, curriculum aligned educational activities from well known and respected publishers, all categorized by subject matter, age range and aligned to the teaching curriculum.</p>

                                                     <p>The growth of tablet computing in just a few short years has been near meteoric, and looks set to revolutionize the way we interact with technology on a daily bases. Tablet computers undoubtedly have a place in education, but before deploying any solution, careful consideration must be given to the use, content, manageability and security of both the devices and the students.</p>
                                                     <p>Maintaining a sound strategy for device adoption, control and manageability is essential; otherwise it is likely that any real learning benefit will be lost. Understanding the use cases, looking at the educational benefits and ensuring there is a clear plan for deployment will ensure these devices deliver on their promise for students. </p>
